 * **Note**: While normally it is good practice to wrap your javascript in an

 * here. If you do, the automated tests will not be able to see your functions.
 * If you don't know what an iffe is, don't worry about it :)
 *
 * This file is for defining the following functions. See README.md for more detail.
 * isTrue
 * isFalse
 * not
 * addOne
 * isEven
 * isIdentical
 * isEqual
 * or
 * and
 * concat

//Exercise 1
function isTrue(param){
    return param === true;
}

//Exercise 2
function isFalse(param){
    return param === false;
}

//Exercise 3
function not(param){
    return !param;
}
